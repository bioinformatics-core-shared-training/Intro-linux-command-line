This course is based upon the materials provided by the Data Carpentry community.
Specfically the Genomics track (which is in development)
We use a locally-installed VM to provide a learning environment and where this causes
disjoints with the DC AWS learning environment your trainers will assist you.   
[Connecting to the courses Virtual machine (VM)](logon.md).   

The course is taught by staff from the CRUK Cambridge Institutes IT service and 
the Bioinformatics Core. We are interested in the Genomics track as our main
target audience are scientists performing bioinformatical analyses of genomic data.

An [Etherpad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/cruk_cl_linux_2019) which is a form 
of electronic whiteboard is provided for participants to post questions to the
Trainers.
